Description
-----------

Scientific software development has transitioned from a field devoted almost
entirely to numerical methods to one that increasingly relies on more advanced
management of data and development of analysis workflows that involve multiple
tools strung together in a sequence, and also numerical methods.

This course is designed to introduce a variety of concepts that will make
engineers and scientists more effective at developing software that
facilitates modern engineering analysis.  

Assessment
----------

Homework: 60%
=============
 - approximately weekly
 - continuation of in-class exercises
 - develop skills and proficiency

Project: 40%
============
 - implement your own software and/or contribution to an open source software project
 - should use a variety of skills learned in class
